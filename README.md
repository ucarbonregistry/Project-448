___________________
The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity. The
project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGâ€™s) into the atmosphere, by
displacing the equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel fossil
fuel- based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the grid. In the absence of the
project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated from the fossil fuel-based
power plant. Whereas the electricity generation from operation of Wind Energy Convertors (WEC) is
emission free.
